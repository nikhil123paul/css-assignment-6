    Sahara, (from Arabic ṣaḥrāʾ, “desert”) largest desert in the world. Filling nearly all of northern Africa, it
    measures approximately 3,000 miles (4,800 km) from east to west and between 800 and 1,200 miles from north to south
    and has a total area of some 3,320,000 square miles (8,600,000 square km); the actual area varies as the desert
    expands and contracts over time. The Sahara is bordered in the west by the Atlantic Ocean, in the north by the Atlas
    Mountains and Mediterranean Sea, in the east by the Red Sea, and in the south by the Sahel—a semiarid region that
    forms a transitional zone between the Sahara to the north and the belt of humid savannas to the south.
